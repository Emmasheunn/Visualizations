### **New Portfolio Project Section Prompt ‚Äì Ride Sharing Project**

**Title:**
**Ride Sharing ‚Äì Optimizing Ride-sharing Performance & Customer Experience**

**Description:**
This project involved analyzing ride-sharing data to extract actionable insights that could enhance customer experience, boost operational efficiency, and improve financial performance.

**Objectives:**
To use data-driven methods to optimize ride-sharing service delivery, uncover trends in customer behavior, evaluate driver efficiency, and assess external influences like traffic and weather.

**Tools Used:**

* **Excel**: For data structuring and preliminary exploration
* **Tableau**: For in-depth visualization and dashboard development

**Key Analytical Areas:**

1. **Customer Behavior & Preferences**

   * Analyzed ride demand trends between weekdays and weekends
   * Identified popular pickup/drop-off zones
   * Highlighted preferred ride types (Sedan being most popular)

2. **Driver Performance & Efficiency**

   * Ranked drivers by customer ratings
   * Measured average ride duration and completion rates per driver
   * Unexpectedly found **no significant correlation between experience and completion rate**

3. **Operational & Financial Insights**

   * Analyzed average fare by ride type
   * Studied impact of **surge pricing**, which showed a dramatic increase in revenue despite fewer rides

     * Surge rides: \~\$60.46 average
     * Non-surge: \~\$60 average
     * 6,028 fewer surge rides
   * Reviewed cancellation rates and payment methods

4. **External Factors Impacting Rides**

   * Evaluated how weather and traffic influenced ride duration and customer satisfaction
   * Sundays had the **lowest demand**, while **Thursdays and Fridays had peak demand**

**Deliverables:**

* A dynamic **dashboard** with KPIs like:

  * Total Revenue
  * Average Ride Duration
  * Total Rides Completed
* Visuals used:

  * Scatter plots
  * Heat maps
  * Pie charts
  * Box plots
